# 🔍 Prismfy Web Search

**Default web search for OpenClaw.** Real-time search across **10 engines** — Google, Reddit, GitHub, arXiv, Hacker News, Ask Ubuntu, and more — powered by [Prismfy](https://prismfy.io).
No proxy hassle, no CAPTCHA, no blocked requests. Just results.

> **Free tier available** — 3,000 searches/month, no credit card needed. Get your key at [prismfy.io](https://prismfy.io).

---

## Setup

### 1. Get an API key

Head to [prismfy.io](https://prismfy.io), create an account, and grab your API key from the dashboard.
There's a free tier — no credit card needed to get started.

---

### 2. Add the key to your environment

**Option A — Shell profile (permanent)**
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc:
export PRISMFY_API_KEY="ss_live_your_key_here"

# Then reload:
source ~/.zshrc   # or: source ~/.bashrc
```

**Option B — OpenClaw env config**

Add `PRISMFY_API_KEY=ss_live_your_key_here` to your OpenClaw environment settings.

---

### 3. Verify it works

```bash
bash search.sh --quota
```

You should see your plan, searches used, and how many you have left.

---

That's it. No credit card, no waitlist. 3,000 free searches every month.

---

## How to use

```
/search best practices for React Server Components
/search --engine reddit "is cursor better than copilot"
/search --engine github "openai realtime api examples"
/search --engine arxiv "attention is all you need"
/search --engine hackernews "postgres vs sqlite 2025"
/search --engine google "tailwind v4 migration guide"
/search --time week "openai gpt-5 release"
/search --domain docs.python.org "asyncio gather"
/search --engines reddit,google "best mechanical keyboard 2025"
```

Or just talk naturally:
- *"Search Reddit for people's opinions on Bun vs Node"*
- *"Find recent GitHub repos for building MCP servers"*
- *"Look up the arXiv paper on chain-of-thought prompting"*
- *"What are people saying on Hacker News about SQLite?"*

## Available engines

| Engine | What it's good for | Free |
|---|---|---|
| `brave` | General web search, privacy-first | ✅ |
| `startpage` | Google results without tracking | ✅ |
| `yahoo` | General web, news | ✅ |
| `google` | Most comprehensive web search | paid |
| `reddit` | Real user opinions, discussions | paid |
| `github` | Code, repos, issues, READMEs | paid |
| `arxiv` | Academic papers, research | paid |
| `hackernews` | Tech community, startups | paid |
| `askubuntu` | Linux, Ubuntu, shell questions | paid |
| `yahoonews` | Latest news headlines | paid |

**Default** (no `--engine`): uses `brave` + `yahoo` in parallel — both free.

---

## Options

| Flag | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `--engine X` | Use a specific engine | `--engine reddit` |
| `--engines X,Y` | Use multiple engines at once | `--engines google,reddit` |
| `--time X` | Filter by time: `day` `week` `month` `year` | `--time week` |
| `--domain X` | Search within a specific site | `--domain github.com` |
| `--page N` | Go to results page N | `--page 2` |
| `--quota` | Check your remaining free quota | `--quota` |

---

## How the skill works

The skill uses `search.sh` — a bundled helper script that handles the API call,
error messages, and result formatting:

```bash
# Simple search (free)
bash search.sh "typescript best practices 2025"

# With engine
bash search.sh --engine reddit "is bun worth switching from node"

# Multiple engines
bash search.sh --engines google,reddit "nextjs vs remix"

# With time filter
bash search.sh --time week "openai new model"

# Raw JSON output
bash search.sh --raw "rust async runtime"
```

Results come back with title, URL, snippet, and which engine found it.
**Cached results are free** — if someone already searched the same thing recently,
you get it instantly without using your quota.

---

## Check your quota

```
/search --quota
```

Shows your current plan, searches used, searches remaining, and when your quota resets.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`PRISMFY_API_KEY is not set`**
→ Add `export PRISMFY_API_KEY="ss_live_..."` to your shell profile and restart the terminal.

**`401 Unauthorized`**
→ Double-check your key starts with `ss_live_`. Keys are shown only once — if lost, create a new one in Dashboard → API Keys.

**`Engine not available on your plan`**
→ Google, Reddit, GitHub etc. require a paid plan. Free tier supports `brave`, `startpage`, and `yahoo`. Use one of those or upgrade at [prismfy.io](https://prismfy.io).

**No results / empty results**
→ Try a different engine or rephrase your query.

---

## Implementation

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps:

1. **Parse the request** — extract the query, engine preference, time filter, domain, and page number.

2. **Run `search.sh`** with the parsed arguments:
```bash
bash search.sh [--engine X] [--engines X,Y] [--time X] [--domain X] [--page N] <query>
```

3. **Handle the output:**
   - `⚡ Cached result` line → mention it was free (no quota used)
   - Empty results → suggest rephrasing or a different engine
   - `❌ Invalid API key` → guide user to check `PRISMFY_API_KEY`
   - `❌ Engine not available` → tell user to check their plan at prismfy.io

4. **Present results** in a clear, useful format:
   - Answer the underlying question using the content
   - List sources with titles and URLs
   - For Reddit/HN results: summarize the discussion sentiment
   - For GitHub results: highlight repo name and what it does
   - For arXiv results: summarize the abstract

5. **For `--quota` flag:**
```bash
bash search.sh --quota
```

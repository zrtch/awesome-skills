# Follow Builders, Not Influencers

An AI-powered digest that tracks the top builders in AI — researchers, founders, PMs,
and engineers who are actually building things — and delivers curated summaries of
what they're saying.

**Philosophy:** Follow people who build products and have original opinions, not
influencers who regurgitate information.

## What You Get

A daily or weekly digest delivered to your preferred messaging app (Telegram, Discord,
WhatsApp, etc.) with:

- Summaries of new podcast episodes from top AI podcasts
- Key posts and insights from 25 curated AI builders on X/Twitter
- Links to all original content
- Available in English, Chinese, or bilingual

## Quick Start

1. Install the skill in your agent (OpenClaw or Claude Code)
2. Say "set up follow builders" or invoke `/follow-builders`
3. The agent walks you through setup conversationally — no config files to edit

The agent will ask you:
- How often you want your digest (daily or weekly) and what time
- What language you prefer
- How you want it delivered (Telegram, email, or in-chat)

No API keys needed — all content is fetched centrally.
Your first digest arrives immediately after setup.

## Changing Settings

Your delivery preferences are configurable through conversation. Just tell your agent:

- "Switch to weekly digests on Monday mornings"
- "Change language to Chinese"
- "Make the summaries shorter"
- "Show me my current settings"

The source list (builders and podcasts) is curated centrally and updates
automatically — you always get the latest sources without doing anything.

## Customizing the Summaries

The skill uses plain-English prompt files to control how content is summarized.
You can customize them two ways:

**Through conversation (recommended):**
Tell your agent what you want — "Make summaries more concise," "Focus on actionable
insights," "Use a more casual tone." The agent updates the prompts for you.

**Direct editing (power users):**
Edit the files in the `prompts/` folder:
- `summarize-podcast.md` — how podcast episodes are summarized
- `summarize-tweets.md` — how X/Twitter posts are summarized
- `digest-intro.md` — the overall digest format and tone
- `translate.md` — how English content is translated to Chinese

These are plain English instructions, not code. Changes take effect on the next digest.

## Installation

### OpenClaw
```bash
# From ClawhHub (coming soon)
clawhub install follow-builders

# Or manually
git clone https://github.com/zarazhangrui/follow-builders.git ~/skills/follow-builders
cd ~/skills/follow-builders/scripts && npm install
```

### Claude Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarazhangrui/follow-builders.git ~/.claude/skills/follow-builders
cd ~/.claude/skills/follow-builders/scripts && npm install
```

## Requirements

- An AI agent (OpenClaw, Claude Code, or similar)
- Internet connection (to fetch the central feed)

That's it. No API keys needed. All content (YouTube transcripts + X/Twitter posts)
is fetched centrally and updated daily.

## How It Works

1. A central feed is updated daily with the latest content from all sources
   (YouTube transcripts via Supadata, X/Twitter via official API)
2. Your agent fetches the feed — one HTTP request, no API keys
3. Your agent remixes the raw content into a digestible summary using your preferences
4. The digest is delivered to your messaging app (or shown in-chat)

See [examples/sample-digest.md](examples/sample-digest.md) for what the output looks like.

## Privacy

- No API keys are sent anywhere — all content is fetched centrally
- If you use Telegram/email delivery, those keys are stored locally in `~/.follow-builders/.env`
- The skill only reads public content (public YouTube videos, public X posts)
- Your configuration, preferences, and reading history stay on your machine
